## 🔐 Features

- **Multi-Layer Obfuscation**: Apply multiple layers to make your code highly resistant to reverse engineering.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Supports Python versions 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- **Interactive Input**: User-friendly prompts guide you through the obfuscation process.
- **Automated File Handling**: Saves the obfuscated code with a distinct filename to prevent overwriting.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Provides clear messages to assist in troubleshooting.

---

## 📁 Available Scripts

- `_bes311.py`: Obfuscator script tailored for Python 3.11.
- `_bes312.py`: Obfuscator script tailored for Python 3.12.
- `_bes313.py`: Obfuscator script tailored for Python 3.13.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 installed on your system.
- `pystyle` library for enhanced terminal aesthetics.

### Steps

1. **Install `pystyle`**:

   ```bash
   pip install pystyle
   ```

2. **Download the Appropriate Obfuscator Script**:

   Choose the script that matches your Python version:
   - For Python 3.11: `_bes311.py`
   - For Python 3.12: `_bes312.py`
   - For Python 3.13: `_bes313.py`

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python _bes3xx.py
   ```

   Replace `_bes3xx.py` with the script corresponding to your Python version.

2. **Follow the Prompts**:

   - **ENTER FILE**: Input the name of the `.py` file you wish to obfuscate.
   - **ENTER LAYER**: Specify the number of obfuscation layers to apply.

3. **Obfuscated Output**:

   The obfuscated file will be saved with a modified filename, e.g., `your_script_ob.py`.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you retain the original `.py` file; the obfuscated version is not meant for editing.
- The obfuscated script is designed to run on the Python version it was created with.
- This tool is intended to deter reverse engineering but does not guarantee absolute protection.
